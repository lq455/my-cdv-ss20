## *Nasa TR R-277 reports*
https://data.world/alexandra/nasa-500-years-of-moon-anomalies-r-277-csv
The NASA TR R-277 documents released in 1968 was at that time the single most complete listing of all observed lunar anomalies that were recorded by observers from 1500 until 1967. This dataset turns the document of NASA's documents at that time into csv file that includes date, location on the moon, and discription of the abnormality. From the dataset I see a significant rise in the number of records during the period of the Cold world, which could represent *i)* the founding of NASA gradually contributes to the number of people devoted to the observation of the activity on the moon;*ii)* the tension of the race to the moon during the cold war that led to more research satellite sent to the moon, *iii)* America's paranoia about the activities on the moon for fear of being surpassed in the space war. For visualization, I think I would arrange the records according to the year to see the growth of records at some specific time, and then color-labled the discription in terms of positiveness and negativeness.

## *Whale catch*

This dataset contains the number of different species of whales that was hunted in Northern Heimisphere, Sourthern and in the whole world from 1900 to 2015. Ideally, I would visualize this data by first draw a whale-shape on the page, the skin of the whale is divided into different areas, represeting different areas of the ocean,and each area has different color, from powder blue to red, indicating different number of whales being caught. The colors would change as the year go by. Then, around the whale-shape in the middle I will draw different whales species, each with different colors according to the number of catch every year.

## *Bird-Buiding collisions*
https://data.world/animals/bird-building-collisions/workspace/file?filename=Chicago_collision_data.csv
This data set includes the incident of birds crashed into window in Chicago. It contains the date, the  location, the bird species and also the light levels at that time. For visualization, ideally, I would create an animation-like one depicting the collisions of birds and buildings year by year, to see if there is a growth in recent years, and also I will color-coded the birds according to the light level and species of birds to see if there is a correlation between them and the number of collision.
