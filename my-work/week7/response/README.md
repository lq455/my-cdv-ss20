#Surveillance Capitalism

Zuboff defines “Surveillance Capitalism” as the commodification of private personal data gained by Internet companies in the process of offering service for their users. She states that the intention behind the Internet corporations’ act of collecting their users’ data goes beyond the innocent attempt to improve the user experience, rather, tech corporations aim to exploit all the surplus value of the data they collected. They try to get as much data as they can and then combine these data with the technology of machine learning to produce prediction for customer behavior. In the process of collecting data, using data to produce prediction, and selling prediction to ads companies, Internet corporations accumulate more and more wealth and power, leaving the users to grow more and more vulnerable and powerless.

During the talk, Zuboff mentions that “Surveillance Capitalism” creates asymmetries of knowledge and information hierarchy which erodes democracy and individual welfare. Her statement sparks associations with some of my own experience. Indeed, the Internet corporation knows so much about me, yet I know nothing about them. I’ve experienced myself that there are certain Internet corporations sometimes work in cahoots to exploit such an inequality of information and their tools of prediction to take advantage of their users. For instance, after I searched for recommendations for hotels or tourist attraction in Japan on Weibo, the plane tickets to Tokyo or Osaka was pushed to the front page at ticket selling app in my phone, the price of which all went up for about hundreds of RMB compared to the same plane ticket in my father’s phone on the same app. The current self-regulations and market punishments for such an exploitation of data collection and predication tools pose little intimidation to the corporations, after all, so many companies are doing these sorts of thing, which is why, I’m a bit skeptical about Zuboff’s conjecture that the competitive solution to the “Surveillance Capitalism” could be in the capitalism. Regulations on the government’s side, as well as user’s determination to say no to privacy invading apps, need to work together.
