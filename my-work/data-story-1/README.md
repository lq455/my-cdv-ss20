# Spying The Moon


This project visualizes the Nasaâ€™s Chronological Catalog of Reported Lunar Events (The TR R 277), a document that records the observed lunar anomalies from 1500 till 1967. By emphasizing on the significant rise in the number of records during the Cold War and the correlation between the NASA budget as percentage of US Spending and records increasement, this project intends to explore what the TR R 277 could reveal to us about the tension between the Sovit Union and the US during the "Race to the Moon" in the Space War.
