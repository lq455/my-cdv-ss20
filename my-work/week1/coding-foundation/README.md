#Original Approach
 Originally I used p5.js to draw the boxes...and then I realized that Leon was asking us to use div elements so I made some changes to my codes. But I think that the logic behind using an input number in a loop is the same.

#Coding Experience
 It took me some time to realize that I can utilize the combination of createElement(),appendChild() and buttons to draw boxes and use css to make the buttons look like boxes. The function setAttribute('id','XXX') was also very helpful. However, one of the main problems I met is that when i first finished the codes, I found that every time I change the input number, new boxes were drawn right after the previous-drawn boxes. For instance, if the first time the input was 2 and then the second time I changed the input into 3, there would be 5 boxes on the web. I didn't met this problem when using p5 because I used background(0) to cover the previous boxes. I failed to find a function that could delete all elements with a same id (which was unexpected) and also tried to used reload() function but the experience was kinda off. So I finally decided to use two loops to delete the previously-added elements one by one.
