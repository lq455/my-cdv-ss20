#Original Approach
 Originally I used p5.js to draw the boxes...and then I realized that Leon was asking us to use div elements so I made some changes to my codes. But I think that the logic behind using an input number in a loop is the same.

#Coding Experience
 It took me some time to realize that I can utilize the combination of createElement(),appendChild() and buttons to draw rects and use css to make the buttons look like rects. The function setAttribute('id','XXX') was also very helpful. However, one of the main problems I met is that when i first finished the codes, I found that every time I change the input number, new boxes were drawn right after the previous-drawn boxes. For instance, if the first time the input was 2 and then the second time I changed the input into 3, there would be 5 boxes on the web. I didn't met this problem when using p5 because I used background(0) to cover the previous boxes. Crystal reminds me that I can manipulate the .innerHTML of the div to delete the previous drawn rects and I finally managed to make it work!
