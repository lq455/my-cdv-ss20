**Why does Bowker say "'Raw data is both and oxymoron and a bad idea'" ? (pp. 663)**

I think “raw data” is an oxymoron in a sense that there actually isn’t any data that is raw in the world. Data don’t exist naturally in the world. There must be people to collect them, define them and interpret them. The process of how data come into being involves human action tremendously and is everything but raw. Thus, the idea of “raw data” contradicts the essence of data and therefore is nothing but a myth. However, many people believe the myth of “raw data”. “Raw data” is a bad idea because the word ‘raw’ tricked people into thinking that data can be objective and unbiased, while such existence is impossible. Researches depending on big data and their viewers sometimes neglect the biases and assumptions behind those so-called “raw data”. Thus, the result can sometimes be limited and illusory. However, just because data can’t be raw doesn’t mean they’re not helpful. The thing researchers should keep in mind is that the thing the data represent can be limited and sometimes false, and that the idea of raw data is misleading.

**What could be meant by the quote "'accounting tools [...] do not simply aid the measurement of economic activity, they shape the reality they measure'"?**

The number given by accounting tools can be interpreted in various way. Different interpretations can lead to different understanding of reality, thus seemingly change the reality. I’m not really familiar with the finance world but I think one example of how accounting tools can shape reality would be how the annual profit numbers given by accountants from major corporations like Amazon are often actually far from the real numbers for tax reasons. Because accountants get to decide which number should be concluded and excluded from the calculations. The numbers given by accounting tools can be interpreted by people to say either the company is doing well or not. Similarly, it’s like how the richest businessman in China, Jack Ma, only receive 1 yuan for salary every month according to their accounting report, but we all know that the number is far from reality. The same goes with big data. Data, like the number given by accounting tools, are used to strengthen the proposition of the person who’s interpreting the data. It’s subjective and biased. Data doesn’t equal reality. The interpretation of it is what matters that can offer different understandings of reality.

**In which way is Twitter data limited?**

Firstly, not all people use Twitter, so the data set is limited in the very beginning and can’t represent a larger group of people. Secondly, accounts don’t equal to people. People share accounts, or create multiple accounts, or use accounts to achieve different goals all the time, which would make the data impossible to represent every users’ actual behavior and actions. Thirdly, the company would edit and delete tweets, thus the Tweet data is far from the “raw” data researchers would hope and can’t stand for a representative sample set. Furthermore, few researchers have the access to the whole data set with all tweets that can be the sample so the data set wouldn’t be as complete as researchers imagine.

**If you don't need to login to obtain certain data, then it is public and free to use. Or isn't it? Please share your opinion.**

I think that if the data doesn’t require people to login to get, then it is public source. These data should be free for people to use, but I’m not sure that people should use it that “freely”. Just because there aren’t any legal terms that forbid people use these data, there should be certain ethical regulations that people should follow. I think to determine whether researches using public data sources are ethical or not depends on two terms: awareness and purpose. Are those people whose data become public aware of the risk that their data could be used in research or not? I think that online social media companies should be responsible for informing their users of such potential. Secondly, are the purpose of the research using public data ethical? Researchers should be aware of the fact that the data they use could be taken out of context, incomplete, and limited. Since those researches are using the public resource, the purpose of these research should also be for the benefit of society.
